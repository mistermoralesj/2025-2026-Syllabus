  <h2>Notice of Syllabus Quiz and Required Pre/Post Tests</h2>
  <p>
    The syllabus outlines everything you need to succeed in the course—what you'll learn, how grading works, expectations, policies, and how to stay on track. You're responsible for understanding all of it. To move forward in the course, you must pass an open-book quiz with a score of 100%, which unlocks access to Canvas materials including graded LMO notebook submissions and assignment checks. The quiz confirms that you've reviewed all expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the syllabus quiz, you're required to complete a no-points-loss pre-test at the start of the course. Skipping it will prevent access to Canvas materials until it's done. A graded post-test will also be given at the end of the year to measure your growth and overall progress.
  </p>

      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>This year-long course introduces students to foundational computer science concepts through programming, problem-solving, and systems-level thinking. The first semester focuses on developing typing fluency, computational thinking, and programming skills using Python. Students explore variables, input/output, control structures, Boolean logic, loops, functions, data abstraction, and pattern recognition. At the end of the semester students prepare for and take the ITS Computational Thinking certification exam.</p>

      <p>In the second semester, students transition to the physical and structural components of computing. Topics include computer hardware, system software, networking, IP addressing, and system configuration. Students then move into relational databases and data models, learning how to design schemas, use entity-relationship diagrams, and query data using SQL. The course concludes with preparation for the ITS Device Configuration certification exam.</p>
        
      <p>This course serves as the foundation of the four-year Artificial Intelligence Pathway, emphasizing hands-on experience, conceptual understanding, and interdisciplinary thinking. It prepares students for deeper exploration of intelligent systems and is a <strong>required prerequisite</strong> for the next course in the pathway as well as a <strong>recommended prerequisite</strong> for AP Computer Science A.</p>

       <blockquote>
    <strong>Prerequisites:</strong><br>
    No prior coding experience is required. Students should have successfully completed <strong>Algebra I</strong> and be comfortable working 
    with linear equations and basic mathematical reasoning.

<div class="section">
  <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
  <p>NeoCity Academy maintains high standards of honesty, curiosity, and independent thinking. Students must demonstrate academic integrity in all work; every submission—program, reflection, report, or project—must represent the student's own thinking and effort.</p>

  <h3>Key Expectations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Do your own work:</strong> All submissions must be original. When in doubt, ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales before turning in an assignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not share or post answers:</strong> Never post solutions to assignments, projects, or assessments online, even after the due date.</li>
    <li><strong>Build portfolios responsibly:</strong> Use Canvas portfolios to keep work private; avoid public platforms such as GitHub.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration limits:</strong> Discuss concepts with classmates, but submit individual work.</li>
    <li><strong>Use resources ethically:</strong> Cite sources and avoid copying full solutions. AI tools may be used only when explicitly permitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect assessments:</strong> Quizzes and exams must be completed independently. Do not discuss specific questions or answers with classmates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples of Acceptable Behavior</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Asking a classmate to clarify a concept (e.g., how a loop works)</li>
    <li>Discussing the meaning of an error message</li>
    <li>Using outside resources to clarify a topic (with citation)</li>
    <li>Debugging code with peer assistance without copying</li>
    <li>Requesting clarification or guidance from Mr.&nbsp;Morales</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Submitting code, text, or data written by someone else or by AI</strong> (see AI policy)</li>
    <li><strong>Posting code or solutions in a public space:</strong> Sharing work where others can access it is prohibited. Use Canvas portfolios and consult Mr.&nbsp;Morales before sharing work publicly.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing another student's code before submitting your own:</strong> Only compare code after both submissions are complete and with permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Splitting an individual assignment and submitting combined results:</strong> Not allowed unless designated as a group project.</li>
    <li><strong>Reusing work from another class or school without permission:</strong> Submitting previous work without approval is self-plagiarism.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing assessment answers or questions:</strong> Even minor hints give an unfair advantage. Discuss assessments only with Mr.&nbsp;Morales.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> All work must be original. Violations may result in reduced or no credit, an academic-integrity report, or further disciplinary action. If uncertain, ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales before submitting.</p>

    "Use AI as a step, not as a crutch."<br>
    <span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">— Mr. Morales</span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The school district blocks access to AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Bing AI on campus. Students may use these tools <strong>outside of school hours</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>DO NOT</strong> use VPNs or other workarounds to access AI tools on campus. At no point has Mr.&nbsp;Morales authorized the use of a VPN for this purpose. Mr.&nbsp;Morales will not advocate for or excuse violations of school-district technology policies.</p>

  <p>If unsure whether AI use is appropriate, <strong>ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales first</strong>; he is available to help students make responsible, ethical choices.</p>

  <h3>Permitted AI Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clarifying difficult concepts</li>
    <li>Breaking down and exploring new topics</li>
    <li>Studying for quizzes or exams</li>
    <li>Reviewing Python syntax</li>
    <li>Debugging code (students must also show code versions <em>before</em> using AI to demonstrate original work)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Prohibited AI Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Generating full solutions for graded work</li>
    <li>Writing code that is then submitted as original work</li>
    <li>Answering reflection or documentation prompts for assignments</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Improper AI use may result in a zero on the assignment, contacting parent/guardian, or more severe disciplinary action. Students are encouraged to use AI to learn more effectively, not to bypass the learning process.</p>
