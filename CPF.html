  <h2>Notice of Syllabus Quiz and Required Pre/Post Tests</h2>
  <p>
    The syllabus outlines everything you need to succeed in the course—what you'll learn, how grading works, expectations, policies, and how to stay on track. You're responsible for understanding all of it. To move forward in the course, you must pass an open-book quiz with a score of 100%, which unlocks access to Canvas materials including graded LMO notebook submissions and assignment checks. The quiz confirms that you've reviewed all expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the syllabus quiz, you're required to complete a no-points-loss pre-test at the start of the course. Skipping it will prevent access to Canvas materials until it's done. A graded post-test will also be given at the end of the year to measure your growth and overall progress.

  <h2>STRIVE: Commitment to Learning</h2>
  <p>This course is not about talent—success depends on effort, responsibility, and growth. In this classroom, all students <strong>STRIVE</strong> to grow as learners, thinkers, and teammates. These core values guide every activity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>S – Safe:</strong> Protect the learning environment, use equipment responsibly, and follow lab and school rules.</li>
    <li><strong>T – Teachable:</strong> Remain open to feedback, ask questions, and embrace mistakes as part of learning.</li>
    <li><strong>R – Responsible:</strong> Own choices, actions, and impact—in class, in conversations, and in learning.</li>
    <li><strong>I – Involved:</strong> Participate meaningfully, be present, and contribute to class activities.</li>
    <li><strong>V – Virtuous:</strong> Do what is right, even when it is difficult, and demonstrate integrity and effort.</li>
    <li><strong>E – Equipped:</strong> Arrive prepared, bring necessary materials, and be mentally ready to learn.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>STRIVE is not about perfection; it is about showing up, improving, and supporting peers. Every assignment, discussion, and challenge provides an opportunity to STRIVE toward mastery and excellence.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>School District Cell-Phone Policy</h2>
  <p>Cell phones must remain off, silent, and out of sight during class. Use is permitted only when a teacher authorizes phones for academic purposes. Headphones and earbuds are not allowed during the school day unless required for a lesson.</p>
  <p>Students may use phones before and after school only—not at lunch or during passing. Refusal to surrender a phone when asked is treated as insubordination.</p>
  <p>Parents should contact students through the front office during school hours. Repeated violations lead to parent pickup and additional consequences.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Lab Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Not allowed in the lab.</li>
    <li><strong>Drinks:</strong> Water only, in sealed or capped containers.</li>
    <li><strong>Violations:</strong> The first infraction receives a warning; repeated issues may result in referrals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Attendance &amp; Participation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Skipping:</strong> Results in a referral and negatively affects performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Tardies:</strong> Students should wait quietly outside until acknowledged and avoid disrupting the class.</li>
    <li><strong>Absences:</strong> Students must check <strong>Canvas</strong> and <strong>Focus</strong> for missed work.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Excused:</strong> Make-up work is due within the same number of days absent.</li>
        <li><strong>Unexcused:</strong> Make-up work is at Mr.&nbsp;Morales' discretion and may not be accepted.</li>
        <li><strong>Exam Policy:</strong> A student absent (excused or unexcused) the day before an exam is still required to take the test on the scheduled day; the preceding day is usually reserved for review.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Learning Targets and Standards-Based Grading</h2>
  <p>Grades reflect mastery of Learning Mastery Outcomes (LMOs) assigned to each unit. Every assignment contributes evidence of understanding.</p>

  <h3>Grading Breakdown</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 – Proficient (99%)</li>
    <li>3 – Nearing Proficient (88%)</li>
    <li>2 – Below Proficient (77%)</li>
    <li>1 – Needs Support (66%)</li>
    <li>0 – Not Enough Evidence (55%)</li>
    <li>0 – Not Complete (50%)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Learning Mastery Outcome (LMO) Category</h3>
  <p>LMOs are assessed through the following formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Short essays, finalized code, or explanations recorded in the digital notebook.</li>
    <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Hands-on tasks that apply course concepts in practical scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Exams:</strong> Multiple-choice (MCQ) and/or free-response (FRQ) assessments evaluating understanding and recall.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Assignment Category</h3>
  <p>Assignments may include:</p>

    <li><strong>Classwork:</strong> Daily practice, coding exercises, and participation activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Exit Tickets:</strong> Quick, informal assessments at the end of class.</li>
    <li><strong>Written Responses:</strong> Short reflections or discussions.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Submission Integrity Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All work must demonstrate a meaningful and complete attempt.</li>

    <li><strong>Activities (During the Unit):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>These formative activities build the skills needed to demonstrate mastery.</li>
        <li>No penalty applies for late submissions. Individual Canvas assignments allow Mr.&nbsp;Morales to review progress and provide feedback before the final notebook submission, project, or exam.</li>
        <li>Completion is required to qualify for reassessment on the related LMO.</li>
        <li>Feedback supports learning and growth.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Notebook and Project Submissions (LMO Evidence at end of unit):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Notebooks and Projects serve as final evidence of understanding.</li>
        <li>Submitting a placeholder file (blank or incomplete) results in <strong>0 – Not Complete</strong> and disqualifies the student from reassessment.</li>
        <li>Submitting nothing is treated the same.</li>
        <li>Meaningful, original work is required for reassessment eligibility.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Extensions apply only if pre-approved or outlined in a 504/IEP.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Reassessment Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reassessment is available to students who meet all of the following criteria:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Submitted meaningful, complete work for the notebook or project.</li>
      <li>Completed relevant activities during the unit to demonstrate preparation.</li>
      <li>Requested reassessment within two weeks of the standard closing.</li>
      <li>Have not already used their one reassessment opportunity for that outcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>The most recent score always replaces the previous score, even if lower.</li>

    <li>Before reassessing, students must:
      <ul>
        <li>Complete missing practice work or attend tutoring as needed.</li>
        <li>Meet with Mr.&nbsp;Morales to review readiness.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Extensions apply only if pre-approved or outlined in a 504/IEP.</li>
    <li>An alternate reassessment format may be assigned at Mr.&nbsp;Morales' discretion.</li>
    <li><strong>Reassessment Deadlines:</strong> Reassessments must be completed by the dates below. No reassessments will be accepted after these deadlines:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarter 1:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Quarter 2:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
  <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
  <p>NeoCity Academy maintains high standards of honesty, curiosity, and independent thinking. Students must demonstrate academic integrity in all work; every submission—program, reflection, report, or project—must represent the student's own thinking and effort.</p>

  <h3>Key Expectations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Do your own work:</strong> All submissions must be original. When in doubt, ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales before turning in an assignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not share or post answers:</strong> Never post solutions to assignments, projects, or assessments online, even after the due date.</li>
    <li><strong>Build portfolios responsibly:</strong> Use Canvas portfolios to keep work private; avoid public platforms such as GitHub.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration limits:</strong> Discuss concepts with classmates, but submit individual work.</li>
    <li><strong>Use resources ethically:</strong> Cite sources and avoid copying full solutions. AI tools may be used only when explicitly permitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect assessments:</strong> Quizzes and exams must be completed independently. Do not discuss specific questions or answers with classmates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples of Acceptable Behavior</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Asking a classmate to clarify a concept (e.g., how a loop works)</li>
    <li>Discussing the meaning of an error message</li>
    <li>Using outside resources to clarify a topic (with citation)</li>
    <li>Debugging code with peer assistance without copying</li>
    <li>Requesting clarification or guidance from Mr.&nbsp;Morales</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Submitting code, text, or data written by someone else or by AI</strong> (see AI policy)</li>
    <li><strong>Posting code or solutions in a public space:</strong> Sharing work where others can access it is prohibited. Use Canvas portfolios and consult Mr.&nbsp;Morales before sharing work publicly.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing another student's code before submitting your own:</strong> Only compare code after both submissions are complete and with permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Splitting an individual assignment and submitting combined results:</strong> Not allowed unless designated as a group project.</li>
    <li><strong>Reusing work from another class or school without permission:</strong> Submitting previous work without approval is self-plagiarism.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing assessment answers or questions:</strong> Even minor hints give an unfair advantage. Discuss assessments only with Mr.&nbsp;Morales.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> All work must be original. Violations may result in reduced or no credit, an academic-integrity report, or further disciplinary action. If uncertain, ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales before submitting.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use Policy</h2>
  <blockquote>
    "Use AI as a step, not as a crutch."<br>
    <span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">— Mr. Morales</span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The school district blocks access to AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Bing AI on campus. Students may use these tools <strong>outside of school hours</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>DO NOT</strong> use VPNs or other workarounds to access AI tools on campus. At no point has Mr.&nbsp;Morales authorized the use of a VPN for this purpose. Mr.&nbsp;Morales will not advocate for or excuse violations of school-district technology policies.</p>

  <p>If unsure whether AI use is appropriate, <strong>ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales first</strong>; he is available to help students make responsible, ethical choices.</p>

  <h3>Permitted AI Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clarifying difficult concepts</li>
    <li>Breaking down and exploring new topics</li>
    <li>Studying for quizzes or exams</li>
    <li>Reviewing JavaScript syntax</li>
    <li>Debugging code (students must also show code versions <em>before</em> using AI to demonstrate original work)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Prohibited AI Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Generating full solutions for graded work</li>
    <li>Writing code that is then submitted as original work</li>
    <li>Answering reflection or documentation prompts for assignments</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Improper AI use may result in a zero on the assignment, contacting parent/guardian, or more severe disciplinary action. Students are encouraged to use AI to learn more effectively, not to bypass the learning process.</p>
