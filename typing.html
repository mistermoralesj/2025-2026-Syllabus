    <h2>Why Typing Matters in Programming</h2>
    <p><strong>Typing well matters when learning to code.</strong> Fast typing isn't required, but learning to touch-type on a QWERTY keyboard makes everything easier. It helps you stay focused, write cleaner code, and work more efficiently.</p>

  <p>We start with the basics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Learn where the keys are.</strong> If you're constantly looking down, you can't focus on your code.</li>
    <li><strong>Then build accuracy.</strong> Typos cause bugs. The fewer you make, the less time you spend debugging.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed comes last.</strong> Once your fingers know where to go, speed will come naturally.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here's why typing is part of this course:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>You'll write more code, faster.</strong> Touch-typing keeps your hands moving and your eyes on the screen.</li>
    <li><strong>You'll be more accurate.</strong> Clean code is easier to read and easier to fix.</li>
    <li><strong>You'll be more comfortable.</strong> Good posture and less strain mean you can code longer without getting tired.</li>
    <li><strong>You'll look more professional.</strong> No one wants to type like a t-rex in front of their classmates or worse, an employer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We use <strong>QWERTY</strong> because it's the standard. Every school-issued computer is QWERTY, and most development environments are built around it. Later on, some programmers try layouts like <strong>Dvorak</strong> or <strong>Colemak</strong> for better ergonomics or symbol placement. But for now, QWERTY is what you'll use here and in most jobs.</p>

  <p><strong>Start by finding the keys. Then get accurate. Then get fast.</strong> Strong typing gives you an edge in programming and in your future professional occupation. </p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the official <strong>ClassLink</strong> sign-in page for Osceola County. You can usually find it bookmarked or linked from NeoCity Academy's school homepage.</li>
        <li>Sign in with your school credentials.</li>
        <li>Once on the ClassLink dashboard, locate and click on the <strong>Typing.com</strong> app icon.</li>
        <li>This will automatically sign you into the district-managed account created for you.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Important Reminders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not go directly to Typing.com and create your own account.</strong> If you bypass ClassLink, your progress will not be recorded and will not count toward your grade.</li>
        <li>You must use the official district-provided account, or Mr. Morales will not be able to see your results or track your performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Other typing platforms such as MonkeyType or Nitro Type are not allowed for class credit.</strong> These services do not connect to your official student account and <strong>will not be accepted for grading.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>If Typing.com shows multiple teachers, make sure to select "<span style="color: #000;">Morales</span>."</strong> Otherwise, your progress will not appear in the gradebook.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Your grade depends on using the correct system. Stay in ClassLink and use only the district-approved Typing.com app.</strong></p>

      <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #555;">If you have trouble finding the Typing.com app in ClassLink, please let Mr. Morales know right away.</p>
