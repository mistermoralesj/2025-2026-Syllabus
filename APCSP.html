  <h2>Notice of Syllabus Quiz and Required Pre/Post Tests</h2>
  <p>
    The syllabus outlines everything you need to succeed in the courseâ€”what you'll learn, how grading works, expectations, policies, and how to stay on track. You're responsible for understanding all of it. To move forward in the course, you must pass an open-book quiz with a score of 100%, which unlocks access to Canvas materials including graded LMO notebook submissions and assignment checks. The quiz confirms that you've reviewed all expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the syllabus quiz, you're required to complete a no-points-loss pre-test at the start of the course. Skipping it will prevent access to Canvas materials until it's done. A graded post-test will also be given at the end of the year to measure your growth and overall progress.
  </p>
</div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
     
      <p>
    AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and explores how computing and 
    technology impact the world. Students will learn to analyze problems, design algorithms, and develop programs using JavaScript, while also 
    exploring topics in data, the Internet, and cybersecurity. The course emphasizes logical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, helping 
    students build essential skills for both college and career pathways in technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    This course is equivalent to an introductory, college-level breadth course in computer science and is the 
    <strong>recommended prerequisite</strong> for the next course in the sequence: <strong>AP Computer Science A</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to preparing students for the <strong>AP Computer Science Principles Exam</strong>, this course also prepares students to 
    pursue the <strong>Certiport ITS Computational Thinking</strong> and <strong>ITS JavaScript Certifications</strong>, offering early 
    opportunities for industry-recognized credentials.
  </p>
    <blockquote>
    <strong>Prerequisites:</strong><br>
    No prior coding experience is required. Students should have completed <strong>Algebra I</strong> and be comfortable with linear equations and basic reasoning.
    <br><br>
    Students in the Artificial Interlligence pathway pathway should not enroll in this course, as it covers material previously taught in the first year pathway class. <br><br>
    Students in the Engineering pathway whom have completed the second year (Applied Engineering Tech 2) are also not recommended to take this course. <br>
    In both cases, students are encouraged to take <strong>AP Computer Science A</strong> instead.
    <br><br>
    Please contact <strong>Mr. Morales</strong> if you have questions about course placement.

  <h2>Submission Integrity Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All work must demonstrate a meaningful and complete attempt.</li>

    <li><strong>Activities (During the Unit):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>These formative activities build the skills needed to demonstrate mastery.</li>
        <li>No penalty applies for late submissions. Individual Canvas assignments allow Mr.&nbsp;Morales to review progress and provide feedback before the final notebook submission, project, or exam.</li>
        <li>Completion is required to qualify for reassessment on the related LMO.</li>
        <li>Feedback supports learning and growth.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Notebook and Project Submissions (LMO Evidence at end of unit):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Notebooks and Projects serve as final evidence of understanding.</li>
        <li>Submitting a placeholder file (blank or incomplete) results in <strong>0 â€“ Not Complete</strong> and disqualifies the student from reassessment.</li>
        <li>Submitting nothing is treated the same.</li>
        <li>Meaningful, original work is required for reassessment eligibility.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Extensions apply only if pre-approved or outlined in a 504/IEP.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Reassessment Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reassessment is available to students who meet all of the following criteria:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Submitted meaningful, complete work for the notebook or project.</li>
      <li>Completed relevant activities during the unit to demonstrate preparation.</li>

  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
  <p>NeoCity Academy maintains high standards of honesty, curiosity, and independent thinking. Students must demonstrate academic integrity in all work; every submissionâ€”program, reflection, report, or projectâ€”must represent the student's own thinking and effort.</p>

  <h3>Key Expectations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Do your own work:</strong> All submissions must be original. When in doubt, ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales before turning in an assignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not share or post answers:</strong> Never post solutions to assignments, projects, or assessments online, even after the due date.</li>
    <li><strong>Build portfolios responsibly:</strong> Use Canvas portfolios to keep work private; avoid public platforms such as GitHub.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration limits:</strong> Discuss concepts with classmates, but submit individual work.</li>
    <li><strong>Use resources ethically:</strong> Cite sources and avoid copying full solutions. AI tools may be used only when explicitly permitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect assessments:</strong> Quizzes and exams must be completed independently. Do not discuss specific questions or answers with classmates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples of Acceptable Behavior</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Asking a classmate to clarify a concept (e.g., how a loop works)</li>
    <li>Discussing the meaning of an error message</li>
    <li>Using outside resources to clarify a topic (with citation)</li>
    <li>Debugging code with peer assistance without copying</li>
    <li>Requesting clarification or guidance from Mr.&nbsp;Morales</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Submitting code, text, or data written by someone else or by AI</strong> (see AI policy)</li>
    <li><strong>Posting code or solutions in a public space:</strong> Sharing work where others can access it is prohibited. Use Canvas portfolios and consult Mr.&nbsp;Morales before sharing work publicly.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing another student's code before submitting your own:</strong> Only compare code after both submissions are complete and with permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Splitting an individual assignment and submitting combined results:</strong> Not allowed unless designated as a group project.</li>
    <li><strong>Reusing work from another class or school without permission:</strong> Submitting previous work without approval is self-plagiarism.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing assessment answers or questions:</strong> Even minor hints give an unfair advantage. Discuss assessments only with Mr.&nbsp;Morales.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> All work must be original. Violations may result in reduced or no credit, an academic-integrity report, or further disciplinary action. If uncertain, ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales before submitting.</p>

  <p>The school district blocks access to AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Bing AI on campus. Students may use these tools <strong>outside of school hours</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>DO NOT</strong> use VPNs or other workarounds to access AI tools on campus. At no point has Mr.&nbsp;Morales authorized the use of a VPN for this purpose. Mr.&nbsp;Morales will not advocate for or excuse violations of school-district technology policies.</p>

  <p>If unsure whether AI use is appropriate, <strong>ask Mr.&nbsp;Morales first</strong>; he is available to help students make responsible, ethical choices.</p>

  <h3>Permitted AI Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clarifying difficult concepts</li>
    <li>Breaking down and exploring new topics</li>
    <li>Studying for quizzes or exams</li>
    <li>Reviewing JavaScript syntax</li>
    <li>Debugging code (students must also show code versions <em>before</em> using AI to demonstrate original work)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Prohibited AI Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Generating full solutions for graded work</li>
    <li>Writing code that is then submitted as original work</li>
    <li>Answering reflection or documentation prompts for assignments</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Improper AI use may result in a zero on the assignment, contacting parent/guardian, or more severe disciplinary action. Students are encouraged to use AI to learn more effectively, not to bypass the learning process.</p>
